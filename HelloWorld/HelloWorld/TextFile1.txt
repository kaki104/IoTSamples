The following rule is the root rule. It allows the user to set the color of any permutation of one, two, or three 
properties in a single phrase. The outer one-of element determines the first property spoken and then further 
determines whether that was the first-of-one, first-of-two, or first-of-three properties in the phrase. 
Twelve color names are recognized (see the rule with id "color"), therefore there are 3 * 12^1 ways of setting a single 
property, 6 * 12^2 ways of setting two properties, and 6 * 12^3 ways of setting three properties. In total, that's 
11,268 permutations.
